In this folder we have some mods for GDT (load them as a mods, because some things, like the game.xml won't load in the
root data folder)

- Game xml: this is a small example on how to use a game.xml file for adding things to the GameConfig file without altering
it. This example adds Amy and her palette to be playable (her assets are in the root data and scripts folders)
