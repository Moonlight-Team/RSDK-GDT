# General
### Q: How do I set this up?
A:it says how to do so in [main page](https://github.com/youngerelk1/RSDK-GDT)

### Q: The screen is tearing, how do I fix it?
A: Try turning on VSync in settings.ini.

### Q: Its Crashes when i load it in mobile!
A: Oh yes that... theres a issue with the mobile of V4 that keeps loading the HW menus, something GDT doesnt have, instead you have to use [RSDK VT](https://github.com/Sonic-Geared/RSDK-VT)
Our own Version of RSDK made for fan games that fixes the issue.

### Q: Why is there no Sound effects and the Music in a lower pitch? (V5U)
A:You are using V1.0 this is fixed in V1.1. (not V1.0.1)

### Q: The game crashes when trying to load the main menu or pause screen, what's wrong?
A: once again, use the build in [Releases](https://github.com/youngerelk1/RSDK-GDT/releases) if it happens in the release version then im not sure...

### Q: am i allowed to Fork/make mods or Use code from GDT for my own Projects?
A: Yes, you can make extentions for GDT to add more to the framework
you can also you any part of the project in your own Non-GDT projects.
We dont mind, We just want credit. 

~~### Q: Why is it one Zone?~~
~~A: This is a Framework, Not a game, we made the zones as a quick tech demo.~~
This is now outdated, we added a new zone in.

### Q: Does it work on Mobile
A: yes. but if your using V4 use [RSDK VT](https://github.com/Sonic-Geared/RSDK-VT)
Instead. 

### Q: Why use RSDK as a Game Engine?
A: RSDK Original Purpose was For Fan games, We wanted to Show that it Can be used for more than just mods or just playing existing games.

### Q: does it work on V3 or non-U V5- 
A: Stop, We are not making GDT for those, im sorry but for those on your own. 

### Q: Why is the level so bland?
A: First Off, that was a Tech demo we made within **5 weeks** we are planning to improve it in 2.0 (and if its out by now its already fixed) its ***not*** a Excuse to think badly of the framework, *cough* SSRG *cough*
